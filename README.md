Automated GitHub Actions workflows for testing React Native ecosystem libraries against nightly builds.

## Overview

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that automatically test **popular React Native OSS libraries** against React Native **nightly builds**. The system runs daily to catch breaking changes early and ensure ecosystem compatibility with upcoming React Native releases.

Specifically this repo will:
- Run a daily job **every night at 4:15 AM UTC** via GitHub Actions scheduled workflows
- Testing the latest `react-native@nightly` build against a list of popular libraries, such as:
  - `react-native-async-storage`
  - `react-native-gesture-handler`
  - `react-native-reanimated`
  - And many more...
- Run a build for both Android and iOS
- Send a Discord message for failure alerts and status updates
- Store results in Firebase for historical tracking and run comparison to identify newly broken or recovered libraries

#### How to apply?

If you're a library maintainer, you can now sign up to be part of our nightly testing to make sure your library will keep on working. Read more in the Discussions and Proposals discussion:
* https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions/931

### Website

The test results are also published on the website, which is available on the following address:
* https://react-native-community.github.io/nightly-tests/

To learn more about website app, see [the README file](./website/README.md) in the `website` directory.

## Contributing

### Working with Patch Files

Some libraries may require modifications to the React Native template (e.g., editing pod files, manifest files) to work properly with nightly builds. For detailed instructions on creating and applying patch files, see the [Patch Instructions](patch.md) guide.
